# A Bit About the Who and the Why

As I am writing this, I have been a CPA for almost 5 years and almost 10 years since I started working as an accountant. Like many of you, I job is mostly about getting numbers (whether with currency sign on or not) from one side to another, hoping that people can make better decisions or my co-workers can get their work done and much more effectively. I really enjoy playing these roles and I am amazed how good data are changing co-wokers' and management's work life.

My career path isn't always like this fulfilling. Also just like many of you, I had a handful of tasks to do. Due to either poor data quality or various complicated yet repetitive reporting, my management accounting life has been quite cumbersome. I was quite functional with Excel and my-workers like what I did, but you are also looking at a naturually curious person. I knew the tasks on hand can be done much more effectively and elegantly, but because all my toolbox was Excel, I lacked of: a) imagination of what's possible and b) actual skillsets to design and implement. Courtesy of COVID, when social life wasn't much of an option, a soul search put me a path of Data Analytics. It was a lot of work for an accountant with next to zero computer science training and programming skills, but if you feel stuck like my prior accounting life, I can guarantee you that it can be done and the reward is quite immense. I have the conviction now, that analytics skills is already written on the wall for accountants' future.

Fast forward to today, it boggles my mind to no end. I have talked to many fellow CPAs, and they feel constantly either "left out" by the data analytics or they don't belong to such a world. So why? Why so many businesses or their financial units struggle to pull off business analytics projects even though they have identified the right use cases? 

Good thing you are looking at an accountant, I can relate to what you feel. A lot lies in the technological literacy barrier. On the one hand, most of the accountants were not equipped with data technology/programming at all through their formal edcuation, so it is hard for us to pivot to analytics or to lead business intelligence projects. After all, you can't be blamed what you don't know. On the other hand, the analytics professionals and educators usually have mastery of their fields, and they cannot relate to accounting folks' learning needs and bridge them over properly, which usually leads to dismay outcomes. The gap has been virtually left unattended long enough that CPA community starts feeling "left out", which is quite unfortunate.  

My fellow accountants, you have gone through a lot to be come CPAs, so you definitely have the intelligence for data analytics, but you just need a bit of help, from one of your own, to overcome the fear of unknown technologies, to make that first step to write their first line of codes, to get their first project done, and to strategize and lead their organizational analytics projects. I hope to be that person for you, to get you to make that first baby-step. 

Education is more just a job for me, it is more like a mission or calling: support others to succeed and be the change they desire through knowledge sharing and hardworking. I have no intention to keep my knowledge and experience to myself, or that would be a rather lonely world where I will have to live in. Seeing others' success through me is my privilege and fulfilling joy. Hopefully, not too long, you will feel in good hands with me.
