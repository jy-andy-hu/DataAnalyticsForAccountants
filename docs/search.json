    "section": "",
    "text": "As I am writing this, I have been a CPA for 5 years and almost 10 years since I started working as an accountant. Like many of you, my job is mostly about getting numbers and reports from one side to another, hoping that people can have a more intelligent and productive life about decisions involving lots of dollar signs. I really enjoy playing these roles and I am amazed how good data are changing co-wokers’ and management’s work life.\nMy accounting career life isn’t always like this fulfilling. Also just like many of you, I had a handful. Due to either poor data quality or various complicated yet repetitive reporting, my accounting life has been quite cumbersome and quite frankly defeating at times. I was quite functional with Excel, even praised by my boss and my-workers sometimes, but I still felt pulling my hair off from time to time. Here are a few common examples:\n\nsome elegant and impactful data visualization that can only live as my imagination, but not in my deliverables;\nI could get one Excel workbook done but I need to repeat for 20 other similar Excel workbooks;\ndata are in a relational database, on a webpage or PDF documents, but I didn’t know how to pull them together. Friends at IT were always busy to save their world already…\n\nIt felt very defeating. I wanted to get to the accounting part of the tasks done, and yet, I just couldn’t even activate my accounting skills because the data or tools were just not there. The despairation is real, others want outputs and I must deliver. I lacked of: a) imagination of what’s possible and b) the actual skillsets to design and implement solutions. I then began to realize Excel was a bottleneck not a solution, regardless of how everyone else thought I were good with it.\nCourtesy of COVID, when social life wasn’t much of a thing, a soul search put me a path of data analytics. It was quite some work for an accountant with next to zero computer science training or programming skills, but it was very much doable and the reward is immense. I have the conviction now, that the era where data analytics should be handled by “IT” or “specialists” is over. Analytics skills are well charted on the wall for accountants’ future. I.e. it will be a literacy requirement.\nFast forward to today, it boggles my mind to no end. I have talked to many fellow CPAs, and they feel constantly they have no footing in analytics. Why data analytics changed my accounting life but not so much for the others? Why so many businesses or their finance/accounting team struggle to pull off business analytics projects and can’t realize returns on their investment in analytics?\nGood thing you are looking at an accountant, I relate this too well. A lot lie in the lack of technological literacy. Two folds on this:\n\nMost of the accountants are not equipped with data technology/programming at all through their formal edcuation. Analytics by definition involves programmatic processes, so it is hard for us start analytics or to lead modern business intelligence projects. After all, you can’t be blamed for or be comfortable with what you don’t know.\nMost of analytics professionals and educators usually have mastery of their fields, and they cannot properly relate to accounting folks’ learning needs and bridge them over properly. This usually leads to dismay learners.\n\nThis consistent demand and supply awkwardness leaves the CPA community unattended long enough that accountants start feeling “left out”, which is quite unfortunate.\nMy fellow accountants, you have gone through a lot to be come CPAs, so you definitely have the curiosity, intelligence and perseverance for data analytics. You just need a bit of hand-holding and a few leads, especially from one of your own:\n\nto overcome the fear of the unknown - data technologies\nto make that first step to write their first line of codes\nto get their first project done, and eventually,\nto strategize and lead their organizational analytics projects.\n\nI hope to be that person for you, to get you to make that first baby-step. Analytics changed my accounting life, it can change yours, too.\nI have taught in colleges and universities for 6 years and counting. Education is more than just a gig for me, even more than I care admit. To me, getting paid to help others succeed is the best value propositions that I have heard. I fundamentally believe the role it plays for anyone to achieve their definition of success and pursue their desireable life. I have no intention to keep my knowledge and experience to myself, or at least, that would be a rather lonely world where I will have to start living in. Hopefully, not too long, you will feel in good hands.\nTrust me, I am, by no means a genius and if I can do it, you can function in data analytics world, as well.\nWelcome to “Data Analytics For Accounting Folks”, we are getting into the mysterious analytics world together, in a very folky way.\n\nWhat’s Here for You\nOn the navigation pane, you will be able to find a selection of topics and sessions that I created and delivered before. I hope you will find something of great interests and values to you.\nIf you like what you see and would like to collaborate on or to ask me to deliver something for you or your community, feel free to reach out through LinkedIn. You can reach me right here from this page through the LinkedIn logo (upper left corner, under the title).",

This software is called “R”, yes the same as the language name “R”. You can find it here: CRAN R Download.\nWe need to install another software that can help us to be very productive working with R.\n\nThere are many options in this category. The top 2 choices are:\n\nRStudio\n\nThis is considered as the Go-to tool to work with R, highly recommeded for beginner with R. For maximum beginner friendliness, this is what we will use here.\nRStudio Desktop Download Link\n\nPositron\n\nThis is still currently in preview, but it will likely be successor to RStudio one day.\n\nVisual Studio Code\n\nThis excellent to work with multiple programming lanugage environments, but it requires a quite bit setup, so not recommended for beginner.\n\n\nAt this stage, there are many publicly available walkthroughs to install both of the tools. I will recommend a few here, one for each major personal computer environment.\n\nWalkthrough - Install R and RStudio on Windows\nWalkthrough - Install R and RStudio on macOS\n\nPlease note that the R version in the referenced videoes might not be as recent as you will see, but the installation process will be the same.\n\n\nHow to Install Quarto?\nThe curating company, Posit, makes Quarto pretty accessible for all major operating systems. There are many publicly available walkthroughs to install Quarto. I will recommend one for each major personal computer environment here:\n\nWalkthrough - Install Quarto on Windows 10/11\nWalkthrough - Install Quarto on macOS\n\nPlease note that the Quarto version in the referenced videoes might not be as recent as you will see, but the installation process will be roughly the same.",

    "text": "Setup How-tos\n\nHow to get Microsoft Account\n⚠️If you already use or have a hotmail or outlook.com account, then you already have a Microsoft 365 Account. Please skip this part.\n⚠️A free Microsoft Account will suffice. We don’t need to pay for anything extra for this session.\n\nGo to the Microsoft Account Sign Up Page.\n\n\n\nEntre a desirable email address that ends with “\\@outlook.com” (e.g. super_andy_hu\\@outlook.com)\nFollow the steps to complete creating the Microsoft Account.\n\nThat’s it! You now have a Microsoft account.\n\n\nHow to Sign In to Excel with Your Microsoft Account\nYou can use your free Microsoft account to access Excel on the web or sign in to the desktop version if you have it installed.\nOption 1: Use Excel Online (No Excel Desktop Installation Needed)\n\nGo to office.com.\nClick Sign in (top right) and enter your Microsoft account credentials.\n\n\n\nClick the Excel icon to start using Excel in your browser.\n\n💡 This version is free and works on any device with internet access.\nOption 2: Sign In to Excel Desktop App\n\nOpen Excel on your desktop app and click Sign In (usually in the top-right corner).\n\n\n\nEnter your Microsoft account credentials, or click on “Add Account”.\nMake sure the account in use (the blue rectangular area) is your personal Microsoft Account.\n\n⚠️ You might be prompted to restart Excel, if so, close Excel and reopen the Excel app.\n\n🧠 Why sign in and use personal account?\n\nUse Anaconda Code and other add-ins\nTo avoid any conflicts with your work Microsoft Account.\n\n\n\nHow to Install Anaconda Toolbox\n💡 Anaconda Toolbox (also come together with Anaconda Code) is an Excel Add-ins (Something that doesn’t ship with Excel itself, but can be added as optional component.). It lets you write and run Python code directly inside Microsoft Excel. This means you can use Python’s powerful data analysis and visualization tools without leaving your spreadsheet.\n\nLaunch Excel, head to “Home” tab 👉🏻 “Add-in”\nIn the pop-up menu, type “Anaconda” in the search bar 👉🏻 locate the Anaconda Toolbox add-in 👉🏻 click “Add” button.\n\nif you are using Excel Online\n\n\n\nif you are using Excel Desktop (example below shows in Windows OS)\n\n\nAnaconda Toolbox add-in should be installed fairly quickly and located in the “Formulas” tab. If you are seeing this something like below, then you have successfully installed the add-in! 🎉🎉\n\nif you are using Excel Online\n\n\n\nif you are using Excel Desktop (example below shows in Windows OS)\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Register Anaconda Account\nIf you have an Anaconda Account, then you can skip this section.\n💡 Anaconda Account allows you to use and save configurations and settings for Anaconda Toolbox. No actual data from Excel will be saved to Anaconda’s cloud unless you specifically saves it.\n\nClick the “create an account” or “sign up” link in the sign-in page of Anaconda Toolbox.\n\nif you are using Excel Online\n\n\n\nif you are using Excel Desktop (example below shows in Windows OS)\n\n\n\nYou should be redirected to an webpage looks similar to this\n![](/images/AnacondaCodeInstall/8-anacondacode-accountsignup.png)\n\nIn the webpage that you are just redirected to, click Sign Up and follow the prompts to finish creating an Anaconda Account.\nOnce you finish creating the account, head back to Anaconda Toolbox or Anaconda Code in Excel and sign in with your newly created Anaconda Account. You should notice that you can start using Anaconda Toolbox and Anaconda Code in Excel now.\n\n\nOn this note, CONGRATULATIONS! You have successfully finished all the technical setups required for this session!🎉🎉\nI will look forward to meeting you all soon and walk through this exciting learning journey together!!",

    "text": "Setup How-tos\n\nHow to Get Started with Python?\nThere are 3 parts:\n\nA software “understands” Python lanugage and commands your computer accordingly. This software is also called “Python”, yes, the same as the language name.\nAnother software helps us to manage different yet powerful “plug-ins” to our vanilla Python environment. Something called “Conda” comes in here. (Yes, unfortunately given Python, we will be dealing with a lot of “snakes” 🐍. Please don’t worry, the snakes here are quite nice and none of them bite. That’s a promise… 😎).\nA fancy text editor helps with writing and evaluating Python syntax. Considering we will type many characters, words etc., having a helper boosts productivity makes a day-and-night difference. We will go with the favorite among the cool kids in the analytics community, called “Visual Studio Code” (“VS Code”). (No, this one doesn’t involve any snakes.)\n\nThe good news is, there is a software called “MiniForge” (Surprisingly, no snakes …) that can take care of Python and Conda altogether. Please see below Install MiniForge. 👇🏻👇🏻\n\nInstall MiniForge\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n⚠️ Please note:\n\nA detailed walkthrough for Windows OS user is introduced here and a reference video for macOS users is provided here.\n\n\nWalkthrough - Install MiniForge on macOS\n\n\nThe Anaconda or Python version below or in the referenced macOS videoes might not be as recent as you will see, but the installation process will be the same.\n\n\n\nFor Windows OS users:\n\nHead to MiniForge download website, https://conda-forge.org/download/. (yes, even the website is called “conda-forge”, we are downloading “MiniForge” still. 😇) and download installer file for Windows OS.\nOpen the downloaded installer and it will greet you like the following:\n\n\n\nAgree to user agreement.\n\n\n\nGo with just install for the current user (“Just Me”)\n\n\n\nGo with the default file path\n\n\n\nMake sure the following options are selected.\n\n\n\nProceed to finish installation\n\n\n\nIn Start Menu, notice that there is something new called “MiniForge Prompt” and click to open it.\n\n\n\nIn the open MiniForge Prompt, type the following and then press Enter key.\n\nconda init powershell\n\n\nYou should be able to see the following:\n\n\n\nClose the MiniForge Prompt window and open Windows PowerShell, you should be able to see the following.\n\n\n\nType the word Python in the command line, you should see the confirmation of a Python found!\n\n\n🎉🎉 That’s it! You have reached to the finishing line of installing MiniForge and Python!!\n\nNow move on to the last piece, install VS Code. See next section. 👇🏻👇🏻\n\n\nInstall Visual Studio Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n⚠️ Please note:\n\nA detailed walkthrough for Windows OS user is introduced below and a reference video for macOS users is provided here.\n\n\nWalkthrough - Install VS Code on macOS\nPlease start watching at 1:50 into the video. This video starts with installing Python and we have already taken care of that previously.\n\n\nThe VS Code version below or in the referenced macOS videoes might not be as recent as you will see, but the installation process will be the same.\n\n\n\nFor Windows OS users:\n\nHead to Visual Studio Code Download website and Download the installer that suits your operating system (Windows/macOS).\nopen the installer and begin the installation process. A series of screenshots are provided below for references. We pretty much follow the default settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🎉🎉 That’s it! You have finished installing Visual Studio Code!!\n\n\n\nHow to Install Quarto?\nThe curating company, Posit, makes Quarto pretty accessible for all major operating systems. There are many publicly available walkthroughs to install Quarto. I will recommend one for each major personal computer environment here:\n\nWalkthrough - Install Quarto on Windows\nWalkthrough - Install Quarto on macOS\n\nPlease note that the Quarto version in the referenced videoes might not be as recent as you will see, but the installation process will be roughly the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSpecial Credit\nThis website that you are reading, guess what? I made it with the help of Quarto!!",
