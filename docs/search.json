You now have a Microsoft account.\n\n\nHow to Sign In to Excel with Your Microsoft Account\nYou can use your free Microsoft account to access Excel on the web or sign in to the desktop version if you have it installed.\nOption 1: Use Excel Online (No Excel Desktop Installation Needed)\n\nGo to office.com.\nClick Sign in (top right) and enter your Microsoft account credentials.\n\n\n\nClick the Excel icon to start using Excel in your browser.\n\nüí° This version is free and works on any device with internet access.\nOption 2: Sign In to Excel Desktop App\n\nOpen Excel on your desktop app and click Sign In (usually in the top-right corner).\n\n\n\nEnter your Microsoft account credentials, or click on ‚ÄúAdd Account‚Äù.\nMake sure the account in use (the blue rectangular area) is your personal Microsoft Account.\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è You might be prompted to restart Excel, if so, close Excel and reopen the Excel app.\n\nüß† Why sign in and use personal account?\n\nUse Anaconda Code and other add-ins\nTo avoid any conflicts with your work Microsoft Account.\n\n\n\nHow to Install Anaconda Toolbox\nüí° Anaconda Toolbox (also come together with Anaconda Code) is an Excel Add-ins (Something that doesn‚Äôt ship with Excel itself, but can be added as optional component.). It lets you write and run Python code directly inside Microsoft Excel. This means you can use Python‚Äôs powerful data analysis and visualization tools without leaving your spreadsheet.\n\nLaunch Excel, head to ‚ÄúHome‚Äù tab üëâüèª ‚ÄúAdd-in‚Äù\nIn the pop-up menu, type ‚ÄúAnaconda‚Äù in the search bar üëâüèª locate the Anaconda Toolbox add-in üëâüèª click ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù button.\n\nif you are using Excel Online\n\n\n\nif you are using Excel Desktop (example below shows in Windows OS)\n\n\nAnaconda Toolbox add-in should be installed fairly quickly and located in the ‚ÄúFormulas‚Äù tab.

You can find it here: CRAN R Download.\nWe need to install another software that can help us to be very productive working with R.\n\nThere are many options in this category. The top 2 choices are:\n\nRStudio\n\nThis is considered as the Go-to tool to work with R, highly recommeded for beginner with R. For maximum beginner friendliness, this is what we will use here.\nRStudio Desktop Download Link\n\nPositron\n\nThis is still currently in preview, but it will likely be successor to RStudio one day.\n\nVisual Studio Code\n\nThis excellent to work with multiple programming lanugage environments, but it requires a quite bit setup, so not recommended for beginner.\n\n\nAt this stage, there are many publicly available walkthroughs to install both of the tools. I will recommend a few here, one for each major personal computer environment.\n\nWalkthrough - Install R and RStudio on Windows 11\nWalkthrough - Install R and RStudio on macOS\n\nPlease note that the R version in the referenced videoes might not be as recent as you will see, but the installation process will be the same.",

    "text": "A Bit About the Who and the Why\nAs I am writing this, I have been a CPA for almost 5 years and almost 10 years since I started working as an accountant. Most of the work that I do is about getting numbers (whether with currency sign on or not) from one side to another, hoping that good business decisions can come out or other folks can get their work done much more effectively. I must say I really enjoy playing these roles and I am amazed how good data are changing co-wokers‚Äô and leadership professional life.\nOne thing boggles my mind to no end: accountants seem constantly ‚Äúleft out‚Äù of the data analytics world or they feel they don‚Äôt belong to such a world. If you live and work in 2020s, you know so many aspired analysts or businesses would want data analytics and want more. So why? Why would accountants feel remote to data analytics? Why so many businesses or their financial units struggle to pull off business analytics projects even though they have identified the right use cases? One reason I found out, through my personal journey, is the technological literacy barrier. On the one hand, most of the accountants were not trained up with the technological literacy and thinking through their educational background, so it is hard for them to pivot to analytics or to lead business intelligence projects. On the other hand, the analytics folks welcome accounting folks with their open arms, but they usually are master of their fields, and they cannot relate to accounting folks‚Äô learning needs and bridge them over. The gap has been virtually left unattended long enough that CPA community starts feeling ‚Äúleft out‚Äù, which is quite unfortunate.\nI know the future of accounting lies with data analytics and the writing has been on the wall for a few years now. Many accounting folks need a bit of help, from one of their own, to overcome the fear of unknown technologies, to make that first step to write their first line of codes, to get their first project done, and to strategize and lead their organizational analytics projects. I am hoping to be that person for you, to get you to make that first baby-step. Hopefully, not too long, you will feel in good hands with me. If you want to find more about me, you can follow the LinkedIn button on this page.\nTrust me, I am, by no means a genius and if I can do it, you can as well. Welcome to ‚ÄúData Analytics For Accounting Folks‚Äù, we are getting into analytics world together.\n\n\nWhat‚Äôs Here for You\nOn the navigation pane (on your left), you will be able to find many topics and sessions that I created and delivered before. I hope you will find something of great interests and values to you!!\nIf you like what you see and would like to collaborate on or deliver something, feel free to reach out through LinkedIn.
