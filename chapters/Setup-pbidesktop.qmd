## Install Power BI Desktop

:::{.callout-note}

⚠️ **Before You Begin**:
  
1. Power BI Desktop is offered on Windows OS only and is not available for macOS computer users (sorry, this isn't me, Microsoft thinks that this is good idea). 

2. Poewr BI Service (sometimes called "Power BI Online") is not a full replacement to our learning experience.

3. Power BI is actually hardware-hungry software that consumes a lot of RAM (memory). It is recommended to have at least 8GM installed on your Windows laptop for a smooth experience.
