## Why Chores Before Our Session Even Begins?

This session is designed to be intermediate level environment in live seminar/lab style. To follow along, we need to have the same tools to work with. We are completing setups before our session so that we can dive right into the good stuff in our session. 

***Please ensure all setups in the "What Setups Do We Need?" completed before joining the session.***

## What Setups Do We Need? 

1. Personal laptop.

  - Windows OS preferred, as I will be using a Windows laptop for the session.

  - ***Why Personal laptops?***
    
    - Company-managed laptops tend to have restrictive IT policies that tend to prohit us from installing the tools as we need.

2. Python and Visual Studio Code (free) (see [how-to](#how-to-get-started-with-python))

3. Quarto (free) (see [how-to](#how-to-install-quarto))

## Setup How-tos

### How to Get Started with Python?

There are 3 parts:

1. A software "understands" Python lanugage and commands your computer accordingly. This software is also called "Python", yes, the same as the language name.

2. Another software helps us to manage different yet powerful "plug-ins" to our vanilla Python environment. Something called "Conda" comes in here. (Yes, unfortunately given Python, we will be dealing with a lot of "snakes" üêç. Please don't worry, the snakes here are quite nice and none of them bite. That's a promise... üòé) 

3. A fancy text editor helps with writing and evaluating Python syntax. Considering we will type many characters, words etc., having a helper boosts productivity makes a day-and-night difference. We will go with the favorite among the cool kids in the analytics community, called "Visual Studio Code" ("VS Code"). (No, this one doesn't involve any snakes.)

The good news is, there is a software called "Anaconda Distribution" (of course, more snakes ...) that can take care of all 3 pieces altogether. The software maker "Anaconda" has made some nice videos that can take you through the installation process. Please see below [Install Anaconda Distribution](#install-anaconda-distribution).

#### Install Anaconda Distribution

:::{.callout-note}

‚ö†Ô∏è Please note:

  a. You don't need to register Anaconda account. Hit the "skip registration" link when you are prompted to register an account. 
  
  b. The Anaconda or Python version in the referenced videoes might not be as recent as you will see, but the installation process will be the same. 

  c. You can also install VS Code separately. In fact, that should be the better thing to do. However, we won't go down that path here, as it involves a bit more setup. We will stick with the VS Code shipped with Anaconda Distribution, which should be more than sufficient for our use.

- [Walkthrough - Install Anaconda Distribution on macOS](https://youtu.be/DNu8pQOYRGg)

Once the installation is finished, search for Anaconda (Here it shows on Windows in Startup Menu). You will see the following:

Click on "Anaconda Navigator", here is what it looks like when it is open:

You will also notice that VS Code is also installed. 

If not fear not, please see below [Install Visual Studio Code](#install-visual-studio-code-(just-in-case...)))

Click "Launch". It should launch VS Code and it will look similar to this:

üéâüéâ **That's it! You have reached to the finishing line of installing Anaconda Distribution!!**

#### Install Visual Studio Code (Just in Case...)

:::{.callout-warning}

This part is **NOT NEEDED IF** you already have VS Code from Anaconda Distribution working.

I am making this portion available, just in case somehow VS Code is NOT bundled with Anaconda Distribution and you need to install VS Code separately. 

:::

1. Head to [Visual Studio Code Download website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and Download the installer that suits your operating system (Windows/macOS).

2. open the installer and begin the installation process. A series of screenshots are provided below for references. We pretty much follow the default settings.

üéâüéâ **That's it! You have finished installing Visual Studio Code!!**

### How to Install Quarto?

The curating company, Posit, makes Quarto pretty accessible for all major operating systems. There are many publicly available walkthroughs to install Quarto. I will recommend one for each major personal computer environment here: 

- [Walkthrough - Install Quarto on Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ8WbI2_Rc4)
- [Walkthrough - Install Quarto on macOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOGGPcWZKUs)

Please note that the Quarto version in the referenced videoes might not be as recent as you will see, but the installation process will be roughly the same.

This website that you are reading, guess what? I made it with the help of Quarto!!
