## Install Quarto

Quarto is a publishing system, especually useful to sentific, research or data analysis oriented publications. It is open-source project, and it is free to use.

The curating company, Posit, makes Quarto pretty accessible for all major operating systems. There are many publicly available walkthroughs to install Quarto. I will recommend one for each major personal computer environment here: 

- [Walkthrough - Install Quarto on Windows 10/11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ8WbI2_Rc4)
- [Walkthrough - Install Quarto on macOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOGGPcWZKUs)

Please note that the Quarto version in the referenced videoes might not be as recent as you will see, but the installation process will be roughly the same.
