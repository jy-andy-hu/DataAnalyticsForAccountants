# Context

Dream College headquarted in Toronto and operates 3 campuses in Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa. 

Now is September 2024, many Canadian colleges are being faced with the international student landscape changing drastically and need to plan for a budget storm looming ever closer. Dream College has been facing their own financial challenges. 

A senior leadership meeting just wrapped up and requested all departments to review their current budget and compared to their own last year budget down to program level and see what could be done. The senior leadership wants department review done and suggestive "cost-effective" measures put forward in two weeks. 

Sitting in Financial Services department, you really need to get the departmental budget report out AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, so that all departments can have more time to comtemplate on their own budget. "Time is key, time is key ..." You keep reminding yourself... "I didn't bring a sleeping bag with me today, I'd better be able to go home at some point..."
