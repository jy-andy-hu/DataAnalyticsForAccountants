PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system. It is free for personal use. It is also available across many different platforms including Windows, macOS and Linux. This guide is written on Windows OS.


1. Head to website: https://www.postgresql.org/download/, download PostgreSQL server installation package, and launch the installer file.

3. Nothing secretive here. We will set the password as PostSQL1234. Make sure to make a note of the password that you entered here. We will need to use it later.

5. Once admin tool is open, expand on "Servers" list and open the default server, here it is called "PostgreSQL 17". You will be prompted to enter the password that we setup earlier.
