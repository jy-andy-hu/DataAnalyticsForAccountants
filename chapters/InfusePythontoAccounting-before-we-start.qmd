## Why Chores Before Our Session Even Begins?

This session is designed to be intermediate level environment in live seminar/lab style. To follow along, we need to have the same tools to work with. We are completing setups before our session so that we can dive right into the good stuff in our session. 

***Please ensure all setups in the "What Setups Do We Need?" completed before joining the session.***

## What Setups Do We Need? 

1. Personal laptop.

  - Windows OS preferred, as I will be using a Windows laptop for the session.

  - ***Why Personal laptops?***
    
    - Company-managed laptops tend to have restrictive IT policies that tend to prohit us from installing the tools as we need.

2. Python (see [Get Started with Python](Setup-python.qmd))

3. Quarto (see [Get Started with Quarto](Setup-quarto.qmd))

ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ **That's it!! That's all the setup we need to get the show going! I look forward to seeing you see the session!**
